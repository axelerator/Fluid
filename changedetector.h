 * Simple detection of changes in the matrix. Changes are located
 * and have an velocity associated according to the speed of the changes.
 * 
 * Usage: Just have a private member of type ChangeDetector in your effect.
 * Call update() somewhere in the animate() method. Use isActive() to locate
 * activity and getVelocity() to get the force of the changes at a certain position.
